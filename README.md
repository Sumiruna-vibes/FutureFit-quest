Futureift-quest is a reskilling app for non STEM professionals to thrive on the future AI disrupted labor market. I am a Vibe coder orchestrating AI agents. Up to this point I have used Gemini 3, deepseek R1 and Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.5 as a pool of agents reviewing eachother. From phrase 3 I started using Claude Code for coding, DeepSeek for prompt engineering and  Chat GPT for pedagogical development.
