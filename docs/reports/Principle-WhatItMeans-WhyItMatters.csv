"Principle","What It Means","Why It Matters"
"Tree/Branch/Leaf Structure","Content organized as hierarchical nodes (6 Trees → 2 Branches each → 3-4 Leaves each)","Scaffolds learning progressively; each level builds on prior"
"Progressive Mastery","Learn foundational concepts before advanced; complete prerequisites before branching","Prevents cognitive overload; maintains pedagogical integrity"
"Dual-Learner Loop","You are simultaneously developer AND student","Architecture must support daily use while code evolves; state must be rock-solid"
"Gamification as Motivation","XP, streaks, badges, levels, fog-clearing (visual progression)","Drives daily engagement; makes abstract learning concrete"
"Career Resilience Capstone","Content culminates in a Personal Career Plan (Stronghold)","Architecture must collect responses throughout learning, compile into exportable artifact"
